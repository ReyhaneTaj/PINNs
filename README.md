# PINNs
Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Scientific machine learning (SciML) represents a significant advancement by integrating machine learning (ML) with scientific methodologies. At the forefront of this progress are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which offer a promising solution. Unlike conventional neural networks, PINNs incorporate physical principles, reducing the reliance on extensive datasets. Automatic differentiation further streamlines the integration of physical models into the network, enhancing adaptability and effectiveness.

This project explores the capabilities and constraints of DeepXDE, a powerful framework leveraging PINNs, to address both forward and inverse problems in understanding dielectric properties.
